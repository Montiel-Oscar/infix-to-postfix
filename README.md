# infix-to-postfix
ExpressionEvaluator: Infix to postfix from a file using QUEUE & STACK
DESCRIPTION:

ExpressionEvaluator is a command-line C application that allows processing and evaluating mathematical expressions in infix notation. 
The program reads a text file containing mathematical expressions on each line, converts them to postfix notation (RPN), and then evaluates the result of each expression. 
It provides a straightforward way to analyze and calculate complex mathematical expressions.

Features:

Conversion of infix expressions to postfix notation.
Evaluation of mathematical expressions involving basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) and exponentiation (^).
Handling of parentheses for proper operator precedence and associativity.
Detection of errors such as invalid operators and division by zero.
User-friendly command-line interface.
This application can be useful for students, programmers, and anyone interested in processing and evaluating mathematical expressions in a C programming environment.
